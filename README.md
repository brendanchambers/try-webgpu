Troubleshooting-- doesn't seem to be working on my setup. I have enabled vulkan and experimental webgpu and restarted chrome, no luck.  

local machine info: ubuntu 20.04; geforce gtx 1050 ti mobile; NVIDIA-SMI 470.239.06   Driver Version: 470.239.06   CUDA Version: 11.4  

tldr, feedback:  I wasn't able to run the puzzles. Correct answers weren't recognized, even if copy pasted from answer window.
